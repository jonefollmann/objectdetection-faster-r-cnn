# Object detection with Faster R-CNN 

Faster R-CNN is a method for object detection that uses region proposal. In this lab, you will use Faster R-CNN pre-trained on the coco dataset. We will detect several objects by name and to use the likelihood of the object prediction being correct.

## Objectives
Apply Object detection with Faster R-CNN to classify predetermined objects using objects name and/or to use the likelihood of the object.
